Tailor
=============

A simple way to tail and combine the output of multiple logs.  The logs can be local or on server[s] you have ssh access to.

Installation
-------

git clone https://github.com/toddsifleet/tailor.git

Features
-------

-Tail multiple files locally or remotely

-Tail the same file across multiple servers

-Combine and color code the output into one terminal


Note
-------

For ssh access you must be using public key auth, and have already connected to the server before.  I did not add any authentication functionality.
